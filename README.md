### Hi I'm Lawrie (she/her) ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly motivated software developer, who has recently completed the intensive CodeClan software development course. Coming from a background as a Creative Lead for a startup, I made the decision to change career, in order to pursue my dream of becoming a developer. 

Throughout my career and my studies I have proved that I have the discipline to teach myself new skills, the ability to learn at speed; and the temperament to thrive in a fast paced and rapidly changing environment. I am seeking the opportunity to harness the knowledge I have gained and continue to grow as a developer!

ðŸ“± I'm currently working on a Mobile app using React Native with a backend built in Java with Spring!
ðŸ¤” I'm in the process of learning JavaScript, Java and Python!
